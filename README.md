# BERT-GermEval18-Classifier in Colab

BERT-GermEval18-Classifier is a machine learning project that classifies German text into categories "OTHER" or "OFFENSE" using the BERT-base German model. The project is implemented as a Jupyter notebook in Google Colab, leveraging the GermEval 2018 dataset and the HuggingFace's transformers library.

## Accessing the Notebook

You can directly open and run the notebook in Google Colab:
